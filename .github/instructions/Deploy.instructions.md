### Render Deploy Commands Overview

Source: https://render.com/docs/deploys

Render services proceed through a series of commands during each deploy: Build, Pre-deploy, and Start. Each command has a specific timeout and purpose.

```APIDOC
## Deploy Steps

Render services go through the following deploy steps:

### Build Command

- **Timeout**: 120 minutes.
- **Example (Node.js)**: `npm install`
- **Example (Python)**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Note**: Not applicable for Docker services; Render builds or pulls the image.

### Pre-deploy Command
- **Description**: Runs after build, before deploy. Used for tasks like database migrations. Executes on a separate instance.
- **Timeout**: 30 minutes.
- **Availability**: Paid web services, private services, background workers.

### Start Command
- **Description**: Runs to start the service when it's ready to deploy.
- **Timeout**: 15 minutes.
