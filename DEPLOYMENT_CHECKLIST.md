## ðŸŽ¯ Your Live URLs

After deployment, update these:

- **Production Web**: https://ecommerce-web-qe180214.onrender.com
- **Production API**: https://ecommerce-api-qe180214.onrender.com
- **Webhook Endpoint**: https://ecommerce-api-qe180214.onrender.com/api/webhook/stripe

---

## ðŸ†˜ Quick Troubleshooting

**API won't start:**
```bash
# Check build logs in Render Dashboard
# Verify all environment variables are set
# Check Dockerfile syntax
```

**Webhook not working:**
```bash
# Test endpoint manually
curl https://your-api.onrender.com/api/webhook/test

# Should return 200 OK with message
```

**Database connection error:**
```bash
# Use INTERNAL database URL (starts with postgresql://)
# Not the external URL
# Format: postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Timeline

Total deployment time: ~30-40 minutes

- Database setup: 5 mins
- API deployment: 10 mins (first build takes longer)
- Web deployment: 10 mins
- Stripe webhook: 5 mins
- Testing: 10 mins

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

1. **First deploy is slowest** - Subsequent deploys are faster
2. **Free tier sleeps** - First request after inactivity takes 30-60 seconds
3. **Logs are your friend** - Check Render logs for debugging
4. **Test locally first** - Ensure everything works before deploying
5. **Keep secrets safe** - Never commit real API keys to Git

âœ… Web app loads without errors
âœ… Users can register and login
âœ… Products display correctly
âœ… Cart functionality works
âœ… Stripe checkout form appears
